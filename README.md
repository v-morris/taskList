Task List

This is a task list that allows the user to 
Add Tasks
Remove Tasks
Mark a Task as Complete
Display All Tasks

I set up the task list as an ArrayList because they are dynamic in size. I had done this project once before, but did not focus on an the Object Oriented approach. This time around, I really wanted to break things down and make sure everything had its own individual purpose. Hopefully I hit the mark closer this time around, although I'm sure I will be researching other projects as well to see different approaches!
